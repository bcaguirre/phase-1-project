# phase-1-project

Welcome to my project!

In this application the user is able to use the activity randomizer to find an activity they would like to do at random. As an added interactive trait, if the user likes the activity the randomizer has chosen, when prompted by a click of a button the randomizer will respond with a friendly message.

Enjoy!
